## Abstract
Pairs of sense and antisense transcriptions that are adjacent at their 5′ and 3′ regions are called divergent and convergent transcription, respectively. However, the structural properties of divergent/convergent transcription in different species or RNA biotypes are poorly characterized. Here, we developed CCIVR2, a program that facilitates identification of both overlapping and non-overlapping antisense transcripts produced from divergent/convergent transcription whose transcription start sites (TSS) or transcript end sites (TES) are located within a specified region. We used CCIVR2 to analyze antisense transcripts starting around the sense TSS (from divergent transcription) or ending around the sense TES (from convergent transcription) in 11 different species and found species- and RNA biotype-specific features of divergent/convergent transcription. Furthermore, we confirmed that CCIVR2 enables the identification of multiple sense/antisense transcript pairs from divergent transcription, including those with known functions in processes such as embryonic stem cell differentiation and TGFβ stimulation. CCIVR2 is therefore a valuable bioinformatics tool that facilitates the characterization of divergent/convergent transcription in different species and aids the identification of functional sense/antisense transcript pairs from divergent transcription in specified biological processes.
